# A fault-tolerant toilet seat protocol

## Abstract

In this article we propose a fault-tolerant protocol for toilet seat
positioning in a hostile environment.

## Assumptions

Jay Pil Choi (2002) in his excellent article on toilet seat etiquette makes
the assumption that toilet users wish to optimize their toilet behaviour for
inconvenience cost. Richard Harter (2005) also tries to find a cost optimum
and proposes three cost minimization candidate criteria:

> (1) Minimize the joint total cost
> (2) Equalize the respective total costs
> (3) Equalize the respective incremental costs

Although we shall not refute their findings given these assumptions, we
propose an altogether different metric to optimize for:

Given the fact that humans on average, regardless of gender, have very
little affection for toilet seats that are covered in feces or urine
[citation needed] we instead propose to optimize for toilet seat
cleanliness. This introduces a novel optimization challenge and a new cost
distribution across genders.

Secondly, both Choi and Harter assume that the parties in a toilet seat
sharing scheme are cooperative. Thus, they try to optimize for a situation
where both parties are receptive to a common solution. For our protocol
however will argue that the use of toilets should, in essence, be
considered a state machine in a hostile environment. This moves the
discussion into a different solution space, where fault tolerance and
protection against adverse agents become relevant.

### Optimizing for cleanliness

### Optimizing for non-collaborative use
